# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Rohit Sarkar]
The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 30, Saturday, 2019].<br>
Will be completing the challenge in 3 phases of 30-30-40 days. With maybe a couple of days of buffer between the phases.
I am going to target a blog post every 7-10 days about the things that I learnt during that duration.
